This is where notes will go that have to do with the hive's effectiveness and special considerations on other bitnodes after the first one.  This readme will be chocked full of spoilers so if you haven't beaten the fl1ght.exe requirements from the early game then read at your own risk.

1. GangWorld:  The first bitnode I did was the gang one (can't remember all the node titles so I'll call them what I call them).  The hive is of limited utility here.  I am running a combat gang so it might work better if running a hacking gang but server money is greatly reduced here and most of your money comes from your gang.  You start with a 32 gb server, which is *just* enough to get the hive off the ground.  Set all workers to 1 thread and make sure that the scanner is set to find things <= your hacking skill rather than < hacking skill, since you are starting at 1 again, and start the hive to generate some early game cash.  Pretty quickly you are going to want that server space to run your gang, and buying servers and upgrading ram is much less incentivized here (unless maybe if you are running a hacking gang) so the hive gets you to that slum snakes invitation and then gets turned off and set aside for later.  At least that is what I'm doing.
  
The gang can't be incorporated into the hive structure really.  There are only 12 of them so the population is too small to allow the statistical mechanics of things like DE and hive algorithms to work effectively, there are no targets to choose between, just tasks, and tasks tend to get run for a while, rather than performing an operation and freeing up space for a new task.  At their core, they are still functionally the same as hacking agents.  You can "grow", aka Territorial Warfare, "weaken" aka Vigilante Justice, and you can "hack" aka Everything Else.  You are best off just doing whatever the highest level crime your gang member can pull off is so it's effectively just a hack function with extra steps where you have to figure out which version of the hack function is the most profitable one under your current skill cieling first.  There isn't a whole lot of really obvious meat for optimization here, however, I do think some kind of optimizer could potentially do better at managing these three things among the 12 people that can perform them than a schedule, so I may try something weird and cool here if I have any ideas.  Ascensions and equipment purchasing add additional wrinkles, and while the most obvious way to cleanly manage the whole deal of performing tasks at the right times, taking over territory, enabling clashes, ascending, buying equipment and augmentations for your gang, and keeping the money flowing, is a rule based scheduler given the small number of agents and the nature of the task pipeline, something that could figure out and optimize around a complex schedule of interconnecting parts like this would definitely be cool.  Don't know if that will be a thing at this point though.
